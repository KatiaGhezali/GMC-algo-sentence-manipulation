# Sentence Analyzer

This project is a part of a programming checkpoint where the point is to create an algorithm that analyzes a sentence character by character.

The algorithm must determine:

- **The total number of characters**(before final period . )
- **The number of words**(words are separated by a single space)
- **The number of vowels**(a, e, i, o, u, y uppercase or lowercase)
